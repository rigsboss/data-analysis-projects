# Data-analysis-projects
Welcome to my portfolio of projects, where I explore real-world applications of data science, machine learning, and AI. These projects demonstrate my growth, hands-on experience, and commitment to solving meaningful problems with data.

ðŸ”¹ 1. Visa For Lisa â€“ Loan Conversion Prediction
Objective: Predict which deposit customers at Galaxy Bank are likely to accept a personal loan offer, helping improve marketing conversion rates.
Techniques Used: Logistic regression, classification models, data preprocessing, exploratory analysis
Highlights:

Real-world marketing problem with business impact

Class imbalance handling and customer segmentation
My Role: Built predictive models to assist the bankâ€™s marketing department in targeting potential loan customers efficiently.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Classically Punk â€“ Music Genre Classification
Objective: Build a Python application that classifies music genres from audio snippets.
Techniques Used: Feature extraction from audio (MFCC, chroma), supervised learning, audio processing with Librosa
Highlights:

Worked with large unstructured audio datasets

Explored feature engineering on sound waves
My Role: Developed a machine learning pipeline to convert raw audio files into genre predictions.

ðŸ”¹ 3. My PayPal â€“ Credit Card Fraud Detection
Objective: Build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using anonymized European transaction data.
Techniques Used: PCA, anomaly detection, SMOTE, precision-recall curve (AUPRC) evaluation
Highlights:

Highly imbalanced dataset (0.17% fraud)

Focus on model precision over accuracy due to class imbalance
My Role: Designed and evaluated fraud detection systems for FriendPay, a PayPal competitor, aiming to reduce financial loss and improve system trust.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Atari Game AI â€“ Reinforcement Learning with Deep Q-Networks
Objective: Build AI agents that can learn to play Atari games using reinforcement learning.
Techniques Used: Deep Q-Networks (DQN), convolutional neural networks, OpenAI Gym, GPU training
Highlights:

Implemented agents that outperform humans in multiple Atari games

Used visual state inputs and trained models end-to-end
My Role: Applied neural networks to dynamic environments, trained agents on different games, and optimized their performance through exploration strategies.
